# Let It Go
## Proposed level of achievement
ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ Apollo 11 ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

## Motivation
Let It Go is a web app that allows you to locate toilets in NUS nearest to you in a jiffy. Apart from this, this app aims to provide a comprehensive set of information on each toilet to ensure the user's demands are well taken care of. With a Google Reviews style, users can also submit reviews regarding each toilet and give it a rating.

Never fear again when you are in a foreign part of NUS, for now you can finally release your faeces in peace!

[And yes, you can submit your own toilets too!](https://nelsontky.github.io/let-it-go-submission/)

## Target audience
* Basically anyone in NUS. Even students/professors who already know where the nearest toilets are can still benefit.

## Bugs, problems encountered, and lessons learnt :(
Milestone 3 was one hell of a ride. The move fast and breaks things mindset we had in the earlier milestones came back to bite us hard as some deep rooted issues that we waved away back then surfaced. :grin: 
1. Keys and security
